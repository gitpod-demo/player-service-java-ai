## Player service

Player service is a spring boot based microservice which serves the contents of `Player.csv` through a REST API. 
This service also integrates with a traditional AI model which is located in `/player-service-model` folder.

APIs implemented:

- `GET /v1/players` - returns the list of all players.
- `GET /v1/players/{playerID}` - returns a single player by ID.
- `GET /v1/players/country/{countryName}` - returns the list of all players by *countryName*
- `POST /v1/model/generate` - Endpoint to generate team using the player-service-model

Player service makes CRUD operations & finder methods with Spring Data JPAâ€™s JpaRepository.

The database connected to this service is `in-memory H2 Database`.
